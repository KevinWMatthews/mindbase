<h1>The Mindbase User Bill of Rights</h1>

If you're like us, you probably want to take a load off your mind.

Most people want a way to organize their thoughts, take notes, store documents, goals, stats, todo lists, appointments, etc, and
link them all together in intuitive ways. There are lots of providers out there which are eager to help you with this - But do
you understand their motivations? You can probably trust them with some things, but can you trust them with ALL the things in
your mind? All of your personal data is precious, but few things are more precious than your innermost thoughts. In the wrong
hands it can be used against you for marketing purposes, psychological manipulation, in a court of law, or people might simply
judge you if they know the finer details of your saturday evening activities.

Whatever you choose to store in Mindbase, We take your privacy and your soverignty very seriously. You own all of your data.
We do not. You don't know us from Adam, and you absolutely should not trust us or anybody else to keep their hands off of your
most personal and private thoughts. If you trusted any service provider with this, you'd likely be taking a leap into a very
unsafe relationship. In the absence of this trust, do you then have to think about censoring your every data recording? That
sounds exhausting, and disruptive to the ultimate goal - To try to become the best possible version of yourself.

Our revenue model is built on delivering value to you. That's it. We don't want to discourage you to leave, and unlike many other
modern software companies, we don't seek to monetize your data, only the value of the convenience we deliver to you. We have taken
steps to ensure that we are physically incapable of selling your data to others, or using it to understand your thoughts or
preferences.

<ul>
    <li>Your data is encrypted end to end. Our servers NEVER see any of your mindbase data in the clear. Your password is used to
        encrypt and decrypt it all on <i>your</i> computer</li>
    <li>Your data is yours. Though we ask you to pay a fee for using the mindbeam service, and ensure ongoing developments, we will
        <i>never</i> hold your data ransom. If you stop paying us for the convenience of our service, we will return all your data to you at no cost.</li>
    <li>All of the software you need to view and manipulate your data is available opensource. If you want to host your own mindbase,
        you are welcome to do so.</li>
</ul>


"Trust but verify" - Although we are dedicated to building a platform that meets these requirements, you should absolutely not take our word for it.
Does our app do what we claim? Is the iOS app built with the same code as it purports to contain?
Ask someone you trust to look at the source code, to audit your network traffic, and to ask the hard questions.

We would be remiss if we didn't talk about the risks here. It is always possible that there could be a critical security flaw in our code.
It's possible that a hacker, a nation state, or other malicious actor might find some exploit, or acquire direct access to your hardware device, thus rendering our encryption scheme ineffective. We do not guarantee that you are
safe against all of these negative scenarios, however we will do our best to create sound software designs which are
as resiliant as possible to these risks. We also seek to solicit cryptographers, white hat hackers, and other security experts to help us improve
Yet another reason why we have opensourced the mindbase code.
